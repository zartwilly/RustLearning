chapitre 3 :

I- variables and mutability

When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you can‚Äôt change 
that value.

example:
    Filename: src/main.rs
    fn main() {
        let x = 5;
        println!("The value of x is: {x}");
        x = 6;
        println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    }
    Save and run the program using cargo run. 
    You should receive an error message regarding an immutability error, 
    as shown in this output:
    $ cargo run
       Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
    error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`
     --> src/main.rs:4:5
      |
    2 |     let x = 5;
      |         -
      |         |
      |         first assignment to `x`
      |         help: consider making this binding mutable: `mut x`
    3 |     println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    4 |     x = 6;
      |     ^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable

    For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0384`.
    error: could not compile `variables` due to previous error

But mutability can be very useful, and can make code more convenient to write. 
Although variables are immutable by default, you can make them mutable by 
adding $mut$ in front of the variable name.
Adding $mut$ also conveys intent to future readers of the code by indicating 
that other parts of the code will be changing this variable‚Äôs value.

example:
    Filename: src/main.rs
        fn main() {
            let mut x = 5;
            println!("The value of x is: {x}");
            x = 6;
            println!("The value of x is: {x}");
        }
    When we run the program now, we get this:
        $ cargo run
           Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
            Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.30s
             Running `target/debug/variables`
        The value of x is: 5
        The value of x is: 6

Constants

link: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#constants

Like immutable variables, constants are values that are bound to a name and are 
not allowed to change, but there are a few differences between constants 
and variables.
* You declare constants using the const keyword instead of the let keyword, and 
the type of the value must be annotated.
* Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, which 
makes them useful for values that many parts of code need to know about.
* The last difference is that constants may be set only to a constant expression, 
not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime.

example of a constant declaration:
    const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;

- constants' convention name
     use all uppercase with underscores between words
     
Shadowing

link : https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#shadowing

Shadowing it is the declaration of a new variable with the same name as a 
previous variable. 
Rustaceans say that the first variable is shadowed by the second, which means 
that the second variable is what the compiler will see when you use the name of 
the variable. 
We can shadow a variable by using the same variable‚Äôs name and repeating the use
 of the let keyword as follows:
 
example:
    Filename: src/main.rs
       fn main() {
            let x = 5;

            let x = x + 1;

            {
                let x = x * 2;
                println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}");
            }

            println!("The value of x is: {x}");
        }
        
        $ cargo run
            Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
            Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
             Running `target/debug/variables`
        The value of x in the inner scope is: 12
        The value of x is: 6
        
The other difference between mut and shadowing is that because we‚Äôre effectively
 creating a new variable when we use the let keyword again, we can change the 
 type of the value but reuse the same name.
 
example : 
        let spaces = "   ";
        let spaces = spaces.len();
        
        The first spaces variable is a string type and the second spaces 
        variable is a number type. 
NB: 
Shadowing thus spares us from having to come up with different names, such as 
spaces_str and spaces_num; instead, we can reuse the simpler spaces name.

However, if we try to use mut for this, as shown here, we‚Äôll get a compile-time 
error:

example:
        let mut spaces = "   ";
        spaces = spaces.len();
        
        $ cargo run
           Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
        error[E0308]: mismatched types
         --> src/main.rs:3:14
          |
        2 |     let mut spaces = "   ";
          |                      ----- expected due to this value
        3 |     spaces = spaces.len();
          |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `&str`, found `usize`

        For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0308`.
        error: could not compile `variables` due to previous error

II- Datatypes

Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time.
Every value in Rust is of a certain data type, which tells Rust what kind of data 
is being specified so it knows how to work with that data. 
We‚Äôll look at two data type subsets: scalar and compound.

# Scalar types

A scalar type represents a single value.
Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, 
and characters.

## interger types 
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#integer-types

An integer is a number without a fractional component.
We can use any of these variants to declare the type of an integer value.

Table 3-1: Integer Types in Rust
Length	Signed	Unsigned
8-bit   i8	u8
16-bit  i16 u16
32-bit	i32	u32
64-bit	i64	u64
128-bit	i128	u128
arch	isize	usize

example: an i8 can store numbers from $-(2^7)$ to $2^7 - 1$, which equals $-128$ 
to $127$.
while an $u8$  can store numbers from 0 to 2^7 - 1, which equals 0 to 255.
the isize and usize types depend on the architecture of the computer your 
program is running on, which is denoted in the table as ‚Äúarch‚Äù: 64 bits if 
you‚Äôre on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you‚Äôre on a 32-bit architecture.
You can write integer literals in any of the forms shown in Table 3-2

Table 3-2: Integer Literals in Rust
Number literals	Example
Decimal	98_222
Hex 0xff
Octal   0o77
Binary  0b1111_0000
Byte (u8 only)	b'A'

example : Number literals can also use _ as a visual separator to make the 
number easier to read, such as 1_000, which will have the same value as if 
you had specified 1000.

## floatting-point types
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#floating-point-types

Rust also has two primitive types for floating-point numbers, which are numbers 
with decimal points. Rust‚Äôs floating-point types are $f32$ and $f64$, which are 
$32$ bits and $64$ bits in size, respectively. 
The default type is $f64$ because on modern CPUs, it‚Äôs roughly the same speed as
 $f32$ but is capable of more precision. All floating-point types are signed.

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}

### Numeric Operations
Rust supports the basic mathematical operations you‚Äôd expect for all the number 
types: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder. 
Integer division truncates toward zero to the nearest integer

Filename: src/main.rs
fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    let truncated = -5 / 3; // Results in -1

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}


## The boolean type
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#the-boolean-type

a Boolean type in Rust has two possible values: $true$ and $false$. 
Booleans are one byte in size. 
The Boolean type in Rust is specified using bool.

Filename: src/main.rs
fn main() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}

## The character type
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#the-character-type

Rust‚Äôs char type is the language‚Äôs most primitive alphabetic type. 
Here are some examples of declaring char values:

Filename: src/main.rs
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z: char = '‚Ñ§'; // with explicit type annotation
    let heart_eyed_cat = 'üòª';
}

we specify {\em char} literals with {\em single quotes}, as opposed to 
{\em string literals}, which use {\em double quotes}.
NB: Rust‚Äôs char type is {\em four bytes in size} and represents a {\em Unicode 
Scalar Value}, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. 
Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width
 spaces are all valid char values in Rust.
 
 
# Compound types 
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#compound-types

Compound types can group multiple values into one type. 
Rust has two primitive compound types: {\em tuples} and {\em arrays}.

## The Tuple Type
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#the-tuple-type

A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety 
of types into one compound type. 
Tuples have {\em a fixed length}: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.

We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside parentheses.
Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the different values in the tuple don‚Äôt have to be the same. We‚Äôve added optional type annotations in this example:

fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}

fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}

We can also access a tuple element directly by using a {\em period (.)} followed 
by the {\em index of the value} we want to access.

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}



## The Array Type
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#the-array-type

Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an array. 
Unlike a tuple, {\em every element} of an array must have {\em the same type}. 
Unlike arrays in some other languages, {\em arrays} in Rust have {\em a fixed 
length}. {\em A vector} is a similar collection type provided by the standard 
library that is allowed to {\em grow or shrink in size}.

We write {\em the values} in an array as {\em a comma-separated list inside 
square brackets}:

fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}

You write an array‚Äôs type using square brackets with the type of each element, 
a semicolon, and then the number of elements in the array, like so:

let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

Here, $i32$ is {\em the type of each element}. After the semicolon, the number 
$5$ indicates the {\em array contains five elements}.

You can also {\em initialize an array} to contain the {\em same value]} for 
{\em each element} by specifying the {\em initial value}, followed by 
{\em a semicolon}, and then {\em the length of the array in square brackets}, 
as shown here:

let a = [3; 5]; ==> let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]


### Accessing array elements
An array is a single chunk of memory of a known, fixed size that can be 
allocated on the stack. You can access elements of an array using indexing, 
like this

fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}


example for accessing of arrays'element :

use std::io;

fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    println!("Please enter an array index.");

    let mut index = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut index)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    let index: usize = index
        .trim()
        .parse()
        .expect("Index entered was not a number");

    let element = a[index];

    println!("The value of the element at index {index} is: {element}");
}

## Functions
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-03-how-functions-work.html#functions

Rust code uses {\em snacke case} as the conventional style for function and 
variable names in which all {\em letters} are {\em lowercase} and {\em underscore}
separate words. \newline
We define a function in Rust by entering {\em fn} followed by a {\em function name}
and a {set of parentheses}.

example:
    filename src/main.rs
    fn main() {
        println!("Hello, world!");

        another_function();
    }

    fn another_function() {
        println!("Another function.");
    }
    
### Parameters
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-03-how-functions-work.html#parameters

When a function has {\em parameters}, you can provide it with {\em concrete values} 
for those parameters. Technically, the {\em concrete values} are called {\em arguments}.
In function signatures, you must declare the type of each parameter. 
When defining multiple parameters, separate the parameter declarations with 
commas, like this:

example:
    Filename: src/main.rs
    fn main() {
        another_function(5);
        print_labeled_measurement(5, 'h');
    }

    fn another_function(x: i32) {
        println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    }
    
    fn print_labeled_measurement(value: i32, unit_label: char) {
        println!("The measurement is: {value}{unit_label}");
    }
    
### Statements and Expressions
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-03-how-functions-work.html#statements-and-expressions

Rust is an expression-based language and it makes up a distintion between 
{\em statements} and {\em expressions}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Statements} are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value. 
        \newline
        Creating a variable and assigning a value to it with the let keyword is a statement.
        \newline
        For example, {\em let y = 6;} is a statement.
        \newline
        Therefore, you can‚Äôt assign a let statement to another variable, 
        as the following code tries to do; you‚Äôll get an error: 
        \newline
        example: \newline
            Filename: src/main.rs \newline
            fn main() {
                let x = (let y = 6);
            }
            \newline
            When you run this program, you‚Äôll get a error.
            \newline
            Explication of the error: \newline
                The {\em let y = 6} statement does not return a value, 
                so there isn‚Äôt anything for x to bind to
                    
    \item {\bf Expressions} evaluate to a resultant value. \newline
        Consider a math operation, such as $5 + 6$, which is an expression that evaluates to the value $11$. Expressions can be part of statements:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item the statement {\em let y = 6;} is an expression that evaluates 
                    to the value $6$
            \item Calling a function is an expression. 
            \item Calling a macro is an expression. 
            \item A new scope block created with curly brackets is an expression
        \end{itemize}
        
        Example: \newline
            Filename: src/main.rs \newline
            fn main() {
                let y = {
                    let x = 3;
                    x + 1
                };

                println!("The value of y is: {y}");
            }
\end{itemize}


### Functions with return values
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-03-how-functions-work.html#functions-with-return-values
    
We don‚Äôt name return values, but we must declare their type after an arrow $(->)$.
In Rust, the return value of the function is synonymous with the value of the 
final expression in the block of the body of a function.

example: \newline
    Filename: src/main.rs \newline
    fn main() {
        let x = plus_one(5);

        println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    }

    fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
        x + 1
    }
